// Package main is a self-contained fixture for the govulncheck allowlist
// self-test (.github/workflows/test-govulncheck-allowlist.yaml). It REACHABLY
// calls a function in a pinned-vulnerable dependency so govulncheck reports a
// known advisory, letting CI prove that validate-go-project.yaml's
// `.govulncheck-allow.txt` allowlist is honored (allowlisted ⇒ pass) and that
// the strict path still blocks (no allow-file ⇒ fail).
//
// Refreshing the fixture: the dependency is PINNED to a vulnerable version on
// purpose, so the advisory is reported regardless of any upstream fix — it does
// not depend on a live advisory staying unpatched. If golang.org/x/text v0.3.0
// or advisory GO-2021-0113 ever stops being reported by govulncheck, repoint
// this module (and the ID in .govulncheck-allow.txt) at another pinned
// dependency version with a known reachable advisory and re-tidy.
//
// The `go` directive in go.mod must satisfy govulncheck@latest's minimum Go
// version (the action installs it with GOTOOLCHAIN=local, so it cannot upgrade
// the toolchain). It is kept at the portfolio's current Go line; bump it if a
// newer govulncheck raises that floor (the allowlisted-passes case goes red and
// surfaces the requirement if it falls behind).
